				<h3>Upcoming Exhibitions</h3><br />

 				<p>Ivar HKeep Clam and Carry On:  The Ivar Haglund Story</p><br />

				<p>August 13 – November 8, 2015</p><br />

				<p>Keep Clam and Carry On:  The Ivar Haglund Story consists of 3-dimensional objects, film, and photographs that document seafood magnate and global adventurer Ivar Haglund’s extraordinary life and accomplishments—emphasizing his Scandinavian heritage, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><br />

				<p>PLU at 125: Lutheran Education on the Frontier</p><br />

				<p>September 26 - November 10, 2015</p><br />

				<p>Scandinavian Immigrants to North American brought with them the core values of their home countries, including a deep appreciation for education. Based on the philosophy of Martin Luther, establishing schools was a top priority for Nordic communities across the United States. Pacific Lutheran University was founded by Norwegian Lutheran ministers in 1890, the first such institution west of the Rockies. This exhibition chronicles how Lutheran educational ideals have been pushed to encompass a greater and greater segment of society, both at Pacific Lutheran University and back in Scandinavia. It is produced by the Scandinavian Cultural Center at PLU as a traveling exhibition in recognition of PLU’s 125th anniversary.</p><br />

 				<p>Skål! Scandinaviaan Spirits</p><br />

				<p>December 4, 2015 – February 28, 2016</p><br />

				<p>Denmark, Norway and Sweden share a “spirited” tradition of enjoying beer and aquavit – sometimes together, sometimes separately.  This exhibition explores the cultural history of these beverages, follows those drinking traditions to Scandinavian-American communities, and answers questions like “What IS aquavit, anyway?” and “How do you ‘skål’ correctly?”   Fun, informative, and engaging, this exhibition will travel to Scandinavian museums across the United States between 2015 and 2017. </p><br />

				<h3>Current Exhibitions</h3><br />

				<p>"Boxing Up the Past, Packing for the Future"<br />
 				Teen Council 2014 - Exhibition UnveilingNow on View</p>

				<p>The Nordic Heritage Teen Council presents “Boxing up the Past, Packing for the Future”. Now on view on the 3rd Floor.<br />
				The NHTC explored the idea of moving to an unfamiliar place, a prevalent theme at the Nordic Heritage Museum, and asked these questions: What would it be like to move to another country and what in the world would you take with you, especially if you could only choose a few possessions to bring? The NHTC created this exhibit to answer these questions, and to compare the experience of moving to a new place in the past, to what it might be like today.<br />
				Learn more about the Teen Council on our Education page.</p><br />


				<h3>Past Exhibitions</h3><br />

 				<p>Finland Designed EnviornmentsFinland: Designed Environments </p><br />

				<p>March 12 – July 26, 2015</p><br />

				<p>Finland: Designed Environments looks at the explosion of creativity in Finnish design over the last 15 years. Examples of furnishings, fashion, and craft, as well as architecture and urbanism, illustrate how nearly every aspect of Finnish life incorporates thoughtful design thinking—from city streets and summer homes to fashion and food—and is marked by sensitivity to form and material. The exhibition is the first significant U.S. museum presentation since the 1990s to examine contemporary Finnish design. Organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts </p><br />

				<p>1/2 - PORTRAITS, RAMONDiana Velasco: Dual Exposures<br />
				April 4 – June 21, 2015</p>

				<p>Dual Exposures by Diana Velasco explores two bodies ofwork: the “Portraits” series highlights subjects who have a Danish parent and a non-Danish parent, presented twice in each photograph to illustrate the two cultural and national backgrounds they carry. The “Family Album” feature snapshots from the photographer’s family albums, where she has manipulated and mixed pictures of her parents and herself. Through the pictures she imagine what her life would have been like if she had grown up in Spain instead of in Denmark.</p><br />

				<p>The exhibition is particularly timely, as Danish citizenship policies are currently undergoing a fundamental change. While traditionally dual citizenship has not been possible in Denmark– forcing people to choose between two identities–the Danish parliament recently voted to approve dual citizenship. The law change is expected to come into force in the summer of 2015.</p><br />
 

				<p>Warner Sallman: The Master Painter</p><br />

				<p>April 11, 2015 - April 21, 2015</p><br />

				<p>A son of Finnish and Swedish immigrants, the Chicago-born commercial artist and painter Warner Sallman (1892-1968) has been cited by the New York Times as one of the most recognized artists of the 20th century. Sallman’s most popular and iconic image, the Head of Christ, has been reproduced over 1 billion times. A selection of Sallman’s works, both Christian and secular, will be displayed on the second floor from April 11-21 at the Nordic Heritage Museum.</p><br />

				<p>Imaging the Arctic<br />
				Maria Coryell-Martin, Kristin Laidre & Finnish photographer Tiina Itkonen</p><br />

				<p>December 12, 2014 – February 22, 2015</p><br />

				<p>This interdisciplinary exhibit explores the impact of climate change on West Greenland’s ecology and culture through the work of three women: marine mammal biologist Dr. Kristin Laidre, expeditionary artist Maria Coryell-Martin, and Finnish photographer Tiina Itkonen.</p><br />

				<p>The exhibit will center around the impact of climate change in the Arctic and sea ice loss on narwhals and polar bears. These iconic species of the Arctic are highly adapted to the extreme polar environment, and are also an integral part of Greenlandic culture as subsistence resources.</p><br />

				<p>In the spring of 2013, Coryell-Martin accompanied Dr. Laidre to West Greenland where she created a collection of field art and stories about scientific research in the Arctic environment. Itkonen’s evocative photographs of the Greenland landscape and Inuit add an additional perspective on the rhythm of life in the Arctic.</p><br />

He captures Ballard at all times of day, encompassing various notions of time, from hours to seasons and years.
